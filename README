LArSoft architecture document
==============================

A rendering is available in the output directory:

output/LArSoftArchitecture.pdf

To regenerate a current PDF, simply run:

make pdf

(no other format is currently supported...).
There are a number of requirements, including a working distribution of LaTeX,
graphviz, latexmk and a bunch of LaTeX packages (`make latexdep` approximates
that list).
