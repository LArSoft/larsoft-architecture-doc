\emph{{[}Q 001{]}} does the scope include human interfaces as well as
software?\\
\emph{{[}A 001.1{]}} \emph{{[}GP{]}} I thought mostly not, but I am not
completely sure what human interface includes. To be clarified.
\emph{(TODO)}

\emph{{[}Q 002{]}} nutools event display facility and simulation data
structures -- still does not make sense to me. Is Visualization one
special kind of analysis or does Larsoft have specific interfaces to
it?\\
\emph{{[}A 002.1{]}} \emph{{[}GP{]}} Visualization is a special kind of
analysis. But our event display crosses the border with its (limited)
ability to \emph{interactively} reprocess the input.

\emph{{[}Q 003{]}} page 4 -- can components of the chain be re-executed
during a single pass?-\\
\emph{{[}A 003.1{]}} \emph{{[}GP{]}} I have added a couple of sentences
in the previous-to-last paragraph of Architecture \textgreater{}
Overview section, that I hope give an answer. The answer is very much in
the features of art, that I have not covered at all in this text. Should
we? \emph{(TODO)}

\emph{{[}Q 004{]}} does event display have a specific meaning - I'll
include it in the Requirements glossary -- it is different from a
generalized visualization and I presume the definition should explain
this? Also, if the event display is in nutools it is not part of
larsoft??? Can we share a glossary in some fashion?\\
\emph{{[}A 004.1{]}} \emph{{[}GP{]}}

\emph{{[}Q 005{]}} Figure 2. You explicitly mean Detector not DAQ ?
Does/shoud daq show up somewhere\\
\emph{{[}A 005.1{]}} \emph{{[}GP{]}} in practice DAQ products is what we
communicate with. It doesn't have to be only that, but I guess that is
it effectively what happens. \emph{(TODO)}

\emph{{[}Q 006{]}} a Fluka interface is in the works with integration
hoped for before the end of Dec. Can you include a sentence on this
interface?\\
\emph{{[}A 006.1{]}} \emph{{[}GP{]}} Erica, confirm? \emph{(TODO)}

\emph{{[}Q 007{]}} page 10.Unit test. These are important. These are not
the only tests. I don't see them referred to and perhaps some more
specifics might be useful?\\
\emph{{[}A 007.1{]}} \emph{{[}GP{]}} I added a section about testing. I
have added a few words also at the point Ruth specified (at the end of
``User code'' section). I think it would be good to add a ``test'' block
in one of the high-level diagrams, but I can't figure out where
(probably in \ref{fig:LArSoftProcessingChain}, but how?). Or maybe we
have to add a \emph{development model} section?
